# Status

## Milestones

| Milestone | State |
|---|---|
| M0: workspace, lexer and parser | done: `yavs parse`, corpora below |
| M1: semantic analysis | in progress: slices S1 to S3 mostly in, `docs/design/sem.md` |
| M2: IR, interpreter, elaboration, kernel | `yavs-ir` and `yavs-interp` done against hand-written IR (below); elaboration without processes done (below); lowering in progress |
| M4: external test runner end to end | first external test runner testbench runs (#110): `VUNIT_SIMULATOR=yavs python run.py` on a pass/fail `test_runner` and the runner's `examples/vhdl/user_guide` give the right pass/fail per test with the runner's `rsim-integration` branch; the runner's own suites next (#112) |
| M3 to M10 | not started (crate spikes below) |

## CI and releases

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs fmt, clippy and `cargo test --workspace` (default features) on
ubuntu-24.04, ubuntu-24.04-arm and windows-latest (MSVC) for every push to main and every pull
request (#134); not yet in CI: JIT tier, corpus gates (#63). `.github/workflows/release.yml`
builds and packages `yavs` with `lib/` for the three targets on a `v*` tag and publishes a
pre-release with SHA256SUMS (#165); `workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run` only builds the archives.
An installed binary finds `lib/` next to itself (#43).

## sem (`crates/yavs-sem`, M1)

- Negative suite `tests/diag/sem` run by `tests/diag_sem.rs` (exact code, line and column; optional
  rendered `.stderr` snapshots); what still fails is in `tests/diag_sem_xfail.txt` (the
  aggregates and case choices group passes, #45).
- Overload diagnostics (#51): association errors of the only candidate (`E1100` unknown formal,
  `E1310` formal twice, `E1311` missing actual, `E1301` at the first extra argument), procedures
  used as functions and functions used as statements (`E1300`), no function with the expected
  result type (`E1301`), an ambiguous procedure call reported at the one actual that decides it
  (`E1302` with a qualification help in the declaration's spelling), candidate lists in help, and
  hints for calls from several packages and for vector/integer operators.
- `tests/stdlib.rs`: std, ieee packages, and the bodies of std_logic_1164, math_real,
  math_complex, numeric_std, numeric_bit and numeric_*_unsigned analyze clean (2008 and 2019).
  `numeric_std_body_rule_1` is the rule 1 review: every object and object alias of the numeric_std
  body has its bounds from the one subtype representation.
- Declarations: objects, subprograms (operator arity `E1303`, function parameter modes, missing
  bodies `E1230`), components, generic and port clauses (components, blocks), attribute
  declarations and specifications, aliases, protected types.
- Types (S3): scalars, arrays, records, element/record/open constraints merged once, resolution
  indications, file element checks; the rule 1 representation is pinned on numeric_std
  (`numeric_std_subtypes_rule_1`, `numeric_std_body_rule_1`) and reviewed for the composite cases
  in `docs/design/rule1-review.md` (`tests/rule1.rs`; recommendation: approve with fixes, findings
  F1, F2, F4, F5, F7, F8 open as #98 to #111, F3 and F6 fixed); the user's approval is pending.
- Generics (S4, `generic.rs`): generic packages, subprograms and (2019) protected types; 2008
  `type T` and the 2019 classes; formal subprograms (`is <>`, `is name`) and formal packages
  (`(<>)`, `(default)`, generic map, checked against the actual instance); package and subprogram
  instances, also inside generic units, by HIR cloning (visible part eager, bodies lazy via
  `Db::instance_body`); `W1501`, `W1506`. The fixed/float packages' declarations, generic bodies
  and instance bodies analyze clean in 2008 and 2019 (#37). Open: anonymous generic
  types, mode views in generic units, instantiating a generic protected type (parser request).
- 2019 front end (corpus fixes #173 to #180): `A'INDEX(n)` and `R'RECORD` type marks, signals
  and variables with bounds from the initial value, variable ports of protected types, `open`
  sub-element actuals, formal packages of design entities; entity subprograms with bodies in an
  architecture. Elab reports initializer-bound signals and variable ports unsupported (#187, #188).
- Static folding: checked i64, values checked against the target subtype (`E1403`) and the base
  range, division/mod by zero and negative exponents, static length mismatch (`E1405`).

## syntax (`crates/yavs-syntax`, M0)

Hand-written lexer, conditional analysis on the token stream and recursive-descent parser for
VHDL-2008 and VHDL-2019 into an owned AST (`yavs parse [--std 2008|2019] files...`). Diagnostics
go through `yavs-diag` (human, short and JSON formats; snapshots in `tests/diag/`).

Parse corpus: `tools/fetch-corpus.sh` fetches the corpora (default `~/.cache/rsim-corpus`), then
`YAVS_CORPUS=~/.cache/rsim-corpus cargo test -p yavs --features corpus` compares them with the
expected lists in `tests/parse-corpus/` and fails if `YAVS_CORPUS` is unset (`YAVS_BLESS=1`
updates the lists). Plain `cargo test --workspace` still parses `lib/` and runs the snapshots.

| Corpus | Files | Pass | Expected failures |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `lib/` std and ieee, 2008 and 2019 (in repo) | 55 | 55 | none |
| External test runner library (`vunit`) | 194 | 194 | none |
| External verification library (`osvvm`) | 36 | 36 | none |
| Third-party parser library sources (std, ieee2008, synopsys, vital2000) | 37 | 37 | none |
| Reference simulator regression and parse tests | 1401 | 1360 | 41: tests of invalid syntax (most of them), PSL, VHDL-87 syntax, `abs x ** 2`, one `` `if `` that needs `--define` |
| Conformance suite `vhdl-93` | 3782 | 3244 | 538: 533 in `non_compliant/analyzer_failure`, 2 other non-compliant, 2 broken book excerpts, 1 VHDL-93 file using `default` |
| Second reference simulator testsuite | 3216 | 2973 | 243: `analyze_failure` tests and fuzz crashers, PSL, 93 code using 2008 reserved words |

Throughput on the `vunit` corpus (read, decode, lex, preprocess and parse; release build, one
thread, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, warm cache): about 5,600 files/s and 60 MB/s (best of three: 5,769 files/s, 62.4 MB/s).

Fuzzing: `cargo +nightly fuzz run parse` (lexer, directives, parser and rendering in both
standards); two 5-minute runs with 8 workers (210k executions in total) found no crashes or hangs.

## sem design units (`crates/yavs-sem`, M1 slice S5)

Entities, architectures (`of e` and `of lib.e`), components, instances (component, entity,
configuration; `l : c;`), generic and port maps (positional, named, sub-element, conversions,
`open`), configuration specifications and declarations (block, generate index, range and
alternative, component configurations with incremental binding), default binding
(`Db::default_binding`, `W1703`), manifest dependencies on named architectures and default-bound
entities. Negative tests in `tests/diag/sem/unit/`; unit tests in `src/unit/tests.rs`. Generic
types, subprograms and packages on components and blocks go through `generic.rs`. Open: mode
views (S7),
subtype indications as generate specifications.

## lower (`crates/yavs-lower`, M2)

HIR to IR for every architecture the elaborator instantiates: generics, ports (unconstrained
array ports take the actual's bounds), blocks (guarded ones with their guard process), generates
(one instance data per region), processes and concurrent statements; scalar and array
expressions with runtime descriptors (bit-planes for logic arrays), aggregates, conversions,
attributes including 'path_name/'instance_name, 'driving/'driving_value and signal attributes
of elements and slices; all sequential statements including case over arrays and matching
case, aggregate targets, every wait form; subprograms with signal parameters of every mode
(arrays too, `DriveSlot` for out/inout), copy-out of logic elements and slices; package
objects at run time (`Lowerer::package`: constants evaluated once, shared protected variables,
package signals and files). `tests/corpus.rs` runs every corpus group plus
`crates/yavs-lower/tests/vhdl/run` (blessed from the reference simulator) through yavs-elab and the kernel; the external test runner's
minimal testbench runs (#110). Design and conventions: `crates/yavs-lower/DESIGN.md`.
Composites (lower2): records (2008 unconstrained elements with runtime descriptors), arrays of
composites, multi-dimensional aggregates, composite constants, access types (`new`, `.all`,
`deallocate`), process-local protected objects (`CallProt`), file objects and textio,
`force`/`release` of scalar signals, shared protected variables (created through `call_shared`),
user resolution functions (yavs-elab resolver over `yavs_interp::resolve`). Difftest: access 3/3,
composite 5/5, force 3/3, protected 2/3, resolution 4/5, textio 2/3 at 1 and 4 threads.

## sem robustness

`cargo +nightly fuzz run sem` (in `fuzz/`, seeds `tests/diag/sem`, `lib/`) parses and analyzes each input
in 2008 and 2019 against yavs's std/ieee and fails on a panic, a hang (`-timeout=20`), an RSS over 2 GB or
any diagnostic carrying "this is a bug in yavs". The negative suite fails on any ICE too, xfail or not.
`yavs analyze` over all ten `tools/corpus` manifests (debug build, so the HIR validator runs; `timeout 60`
per file) shows no panic and no timeout.

External library corpora (`tools/corpus/gen_external.py`, validated per file with the reference simulators; rejects and reasons in `tools/corpus/rejects/`): `en_cl_fix`, `open-logic`, `poc`, `json-for-vhdl`, `vhdl-extras`,
`vhlib`, `fletcher`, `satcat5`, `surf`, `neorv32`, `neotrng`, `vhdl-compliance`, `vhdl-interfaces`, `vhdl-tool-checks`,
`vhdl-ideas` and `vunit-tests`. Several carry a `[testbenches]` section (top units, runner, pass
condition) for the M2/M4 simulation tests. Results: `tools/corpus/RESULTS.md`.

| Run | Fuzz time | Executions | Crashes found | Fixed | Open |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 4 workers, ~1.1 h CPU in total | ~27 min wall | ~280,000 | 3 distinct ICEs (procedure call left `ExprKind::Error`; physical-literal unit undeclared; alias of a selected object name) | 3 | none |

The procedure-call ICE was fixed on main in parallel; the other two are fixed here, all with
regression tests in `tests/diag/sem/fuzz/`. The last 3 chunks (~190,000 executions) found nothing.

## logic (`crates/yavs-logic`)

Done ahead of M3: `StdULogic` with the IEEE 1164 tables (checked against the vendored package
body), `Logic<R>`/`LogicVec` packed vectors in two layouts (nibbles, bit-planes), `BitVec` fast
path, numeric_std add/sub/compare/shift/rotate/integer conversion with X propagation, exhaustive
and property tests, criterion benchmarks. Default layout is bit-planes; see
`crates/yavs-logic/LAYOUT.md`; the user confirmed bit-planes everywhere, signals included (docs/plan.md, 2026-10-18).

## llvm (`crates/yavs-llvm`)

JIT risk spike ahead of M6, behind the `llvm` feature (`cargo test -p yavs-llvm --features llvm`).
Done: llvm-sys 211 bindings (docs/decisions.md), ORC LLJIT with a portable CPU, O2 through
`LLVMRunPasses`, Rust runtime callbacks as absolute symbols, a checked i64 sum that traps into
Rust on overflow, a process body reading and writing a `#[repr(C)]` struct, a 10k-instruction
function checked against its Rust reference semantics, an unresolved runtime symbol reported by
name, and background compilation on one thread with an atomic function-pointer swap while the
calling thread keeps running in the "interpreter". Windows: `crates/yavs-llvm/WINDOWS.md`
(researched, not yet run on Windows).

JIT cost of one generated function (`examples/measure.rs`: `state[w] := state[a] + (state[b] and
255)` with an overflow check, 13 IR instructions and 2 basic blocks per statement). One process
per row, release build, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, LLVM 21.1.8, x86-64-v2. Time is IR build +
passes + codegen and link (first lookup); memory is peak RSS growth over a process that already
created the JIT.

| IR instructions | opt | passes (ms) | codegen + link (ms) | total (ms) | peak RSS growth (MiB) |
|---:|:--:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,002 | O2 | 6 | 12 | 18 | 12 |
| 10,011 | O2 | 50 | 95 | 146 | 28 |
| 20,021 | O2 | 103 | 225 | 330 | 46 |
| 40,041 | O2 | 206 | 589 | 799 | 79 |
| 100,101 | O2 | 630 | 3,100 | 3,800 | 231 |
| 299,001 | O2 | 3,761 | 24,489 | 28,280 | 650 |
| 10,011 | O1 | 30 | 92 | 123 | 25 |
| 100,101 | O1 | 281 | 3,009 | 3,301 | 199 |
| 1,002 | O0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 8 |
| 10,011 | O0 | 0 | 21 | 22 | 15 |
| 100,101 | O0 | 2 | 181 | 193 | 92 |
| 299,001 | O0 | 6 | 637 | 674 | 264 |

Codegen at O1/O2 grows faster than linearly in the size of one function (10x the instructions
costs 25x to 30x the time); O0 stays close to linear. Proposed threshold: O2 up to 40k
instructions per function, larger units stay interpreted (docs/decisions.md).
## lib (`crates/yavs-lib`)

Done: library directories (`yavs-lib.toml` manifest + `_YAVS_LIB` lock, rule 14), `NAME:PATH`
mapping, atomic manifest updates under an exclusive lock, shared-lock reads that never write,
on-demand closure query (unknown library/unit with suggestion, cycles, stale hashes), multi-process
concurrency test. The standard is stored per file (manifest format 2). The analyzer supplies `UnitRecord`s (kind, name, dependencies) per file. A directory with a manifest from before the rename to yavs fails with L0004 (re-analyze).

## kernel (`crates/yavs-kernel`)

LRM 14.7 cycle against an abstract `Process` trait, tested with hand-written processes: time with
runtime resolution and checked arithmetic, drivers with transport and inertial (reject limit)
preemption per element, resolution per source segment, `'event`/`'active`/`'last_event`/
`'last_value`/`'last_active`, force/release/deposit, postponed processes, delta limit, parallel
evaluation with ordered commit (threads and shuffle invariance tested on 1000+ processes),
`SimControl` with run/step, interrupt, value-change bus and phase callbacks. Design in
`crates/yavs-kernel/DESIGN.md`.

Kernel asks of docs/design/ir.md, all done: K1 uncollapsed ports with conversions in the update
phase (no extra delta), K2 kernel-maintained `'stable`/`'quiet`/`'delayed`/`'transaction`, K3
`'driving_value`, K4 `'driving`, null transactions and guarded `bus`/`register` signals with
disconnection time, K5 null-range signals, K7 bit-plane storage for logic signals (bytes for
everything else). K6 (buffered user-file streams) was dropped: disk files are the interpreter's
own and their callers serial (#82). Serial marking reaches the kernel through `Process::serial`,
so shared-variable, protected-type and file users run in order at any `--threads` (#107).

Benchmark (`cargo run --release -p yavs-kernel --example bench -- 10000 <work>`), 24-core host
under load from other agents (runs vary by about 15%), 8 worker threads. "Before" is the byte-only
kernel of the first round, run back to back with "after".

| case | threads | before | after |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10000 counters, work 0 | 1 | 3.3 s (3.0 M events/s) | 3.6 to 3.8 s (2.7 M events/s) |
| 10000 counters, work 0 | 8 | 3.1 to 3.3 s | 3.2 to 3.8 s |
| 10000 counters, work 1000 | 1 | 7.1 s (1.41 M events/s) | 7.8 s (1.29 M events/s) |
| 10000 counters, work 1000 | 8 | 4.3 s (2.35 M events/s) | 4.7 s (2.14 M events/s) |
| 1024-bit std_logic bus, 4 drivers, 10000 edges | 1 | 0.36 s (28 M resolved elements/s) | 0.115 s (89 M/s) |
| 1024-bit std_logic bus, 4 drivers, 10000 edges | 8 | 0.82 to 0.87 s | 0.33 to 0.39 s |

Before, the bus was 1 byte per element with a per-element resolution callback; after, it is
bit-planes with plane-wise resolution (3x faster). Scalar byte signals pay 10 to 15% for the
storage enum and the port/implicit machinery. With trivial processes the serial update and
commit phases dominate, so threads gain little.

## ir and interp (`crates/yavs-ir`, `crates/yavs-interp`, M2)

`yavs-ir`: Program/Func/Block/Inst with 32-bit ids and a `StmtId` per instruction, runtime type
descriptions with descriptor-based layouts (bit-plane logic arrays, records, arrays with dope),
compact constants, natives by NATIVE.md symbol, foreign references, flag propagation
(`MAY_SUSPEND`, `TOUCHES_SHARED`), resume numbering, a linear verifier and a text dump
(`crates/yavs-ir/README.md` says what is stable). `yavs-interp`: `InterpProcess` implements the
kernel `Process` (heap frame stack, waits inside procedures), checked arithmetic through
yavs-std, checks, signal ops mapped 1:1 to `Ctx`, natives (`now`, `stop`, `finish`, scalar
`to_string`/`'image`), VHPIDIRECT calls of scalars, generational heaps with precise-root GC (descriptor-aware, deallocated slots quarantined),
serial marking, kernel-free `call` / `call_shared` for elaboration, protected objects,
std.textio (read/write of every textio type, linear in the line length over many calls,
readline/writeline/tee, hread/oread/sread, justify), TEXT file ops including the 2019 ones, std.env (getenv, dir_*, tool and version
strings, time conversions, resolution_limit, the 2019 time_record functions, call paths and
the VHDL assert state), VHPIDIRECT calls with scalars, arrays,
records and access values (copy-back included), runtime errors with the VHDL stack as
`SimError::trace`, and debug hooks in the style of commercial simulators (docs/design/ir.md 3.4).

Tests (`cargo test -p yavs-ir -p yavs-interp`): 11 end-to-end designs run through the kernel at
1 and 4 threads with identical traces (clock and counter, delta ordering, wait forms with a
wait inside a procedure, overflow with stack trace, bit-plane ops across blocks, access types
and stale handle, GC roots, natives, foreign call, elaboration call, serial marking), 5 debug
tests (conditional line breakpoint with hit count, step over, step in with frame and locals,
global step across processes, signal breakpoint and process table), verifier and layout tests.
Also 5 foreign marshalling tests, 5 textio/file/env tests and a protected-type test.
Not done: `Elab*` instructions (yavs-elab), records with runtime layouts beyond `LayoutOf`,
binary file read/write, the PSL natives, `SetVhdlAssertFormat` with a non-empty format.

std.reflection (`yavs-interp/src/reflect.rs`, `yavs-lower/src/reflect.rs`): all 123 mirror
methods and `'reflect` (value and subtype mirrors, built from the value and its descriptor;
private-heap mirror objects traced by the GC). End to end through `yavs run` for integer,
floating, physical (TIME in resolution-limit units), enumeration and array mirrors
(`tests/corpus/reflect`, 3/3 against the reference simulator, one `ref=hand`). Record, access, file and protected
mirrors are implemented in the runtime (unit-tested element extraction) and wait on the
lowering of those types and of mirror variables (lower2).

## elab (`crates/yavs-elab`, M2)

Done (without processes, which need yavs-lower and yavs-interp): `find_top` (`ENTITY`,
`ENTITY.ARCH`, `CONFIGURATION`), `elaborate` as a pure function (restart test: two elaborations
and two kernel builds give identical results), hierarchy with LRM `'path_name`/`'instance_name`
in both LRM and original spelling, unlabeled processes `_pN`, generics (actuals, `-g` overrides
through the yavs-std `'value` parser, defaults, range check), constants on demand, for/if/case
generates, blocks, entity/component/configuration instances, binding (configuration declaration,
then specification, then default binding), signals split into kernel leaves (records as struct
of arrays, `std_ulogic`/`bit`/`boolean` as bit-planes), the sub-element map
(`NetGraph::select`), uncollapsed ports with unconstrained formals taking the actual's bounds,
static expression actuals, per-process merged drivers, multiple-source check across the
hierarchy, LRM 14.4.2 body-before-call check, `Elaborated::build_with` into the kernel.
Elaboration-time evaluation folds globally static expressions with `Db::fold_with`, evaluates
aggregates, indexing, slices, fields, concatenation and composite equality itself, and runs user
function calls in yavs-interp (the function lowered alone; arrays and records of scalars as
arguments and results through `call_values`); multi-dimensional aggregates and other array
operators are still E2106 (#77). Also done: package bodies and generic instance bodies
loaded before elaboration, a package needing a body without one (E2116), conversion functions
and type conversions in port maps (kernel converters, scalars and arrays of scalars), individual
association of unconstrained array ports, implicit signals (`'stable`,
`'quiet`, `'delayed`, `'transaction`, kernel-maintained), package signals (`:lib:pkg:s`, every
signal of a loaded package, visible from every region), package data initialised once in
analysis order with `yavs_interp::init_package` (shared variables, constants computed once,
#183; a declaration constant calling its own package's function is E2114 before lowering, #197),
external signal names bound in elaboration order (E2117), guarded blocks and `bus`/`register`
signals, blocks with generics and ports, incremental binding, nested and record element
resolution, user resolution functions (one declared in an entity or architecture reads its
instance's data; in a block, generate or subprogram it is E9999, #164). Not yet: conversions of record ports, non-static expression
actuals (#74, needs yavs-lower DESIGN.md request 7), generic types, subprograms and packages on entities, linkage ports, mode views
(#75).

Processes: `Elaborated::lower` lowers every architecture owning a process (yavs-lower) and
`Elaborated::build` creates one yavs-interp process per process instance with per-instance data
(restart test with the interpreter).

CLI: `yavs elab` and `yavs run` per docs/cli-contract.md (closure from the manifests, design
revision = newest standard in the closure, `-g` after TOP, `@file`, exit codes, reports in the reference simulator's
format on stdout). Difftest: see `tests/corpus/RESULTS.md` (93 of 96 at 1, 4 and 4 shuffled
threads on 2026-10-18; open: `generics/generic_types_2019` (generic types on entities, #75),
`hierarchy/external_port_actual` (expression actuals, #74), `hierarchy/mode_view_ports` (record
port elements in lowering)).

## ffi (`crates/yavs-ffi`)

Done: VHPIDIRECT call trampolines without libffi (SysV x86_64, Win64, AAPCS64), argument
classification in Rust, naked asm stubs, up to 64 arguments, and the VHDL to C mapping in the reference simulator's
convention (`vhdl::lower`). Tests: unit tests, hand-written ABI tests and 431 generated callees
compared against direct calls. All pass on Linux x86_64 natively, on aarch64 under qemu-user and
on Windows under wine. The cross commands (configured through the environment, no cargo config):

```sh
# aarch64 Linux (qemu-user, aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc, rustup target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)
CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc \
CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_RUNNER="qemu-aarch64 -L /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu" \
  cargo test -p yavs-ffi --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
# Windows x86_64 (mingw-w64, wine, rustup target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu)
CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_PC_WINDOWS_GNU_LINKER=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_PC_WINDOWS_GNU_RUNNER=wine WINEDEBUG=-all \
  cargo test -p yavs-ffi --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

Open: marshalling VHDL values (bit-planes to bytes, records, copy-back) belongs to the interpreter.

## difftest (yavs candidate)

`python3 tools/difftest/difftest.py --candidate yavs` drives `yavs analyze`, `yavs elab` and
`yavs run`; `tools/difftest/report.sh` writes `tests/corpus/RESULTS.md`: 69 of 78 at 1 thread,
4 threads (identical to 1) and 4 threads shuffled. `std.env.stop`/`finish` end the calling
process at once; check messages print reals as `%.15g`; runtime errors are coded diagnostics
(`E3001`-`E3010`, kernel `ErrorKind::code`) with the VHDL call stack, which difftest reads back
as `fatal` events. Normalisations for the reference simulator's free choices (default assert message without a
path, per-test `ignore=order`) are in `docs/decisions.md`. The 9 failures wait for sem (#1, #3)
and lowering (out signal parameters, `'stable`, `'path_name`, guarded blocks, instantiated
package bodies #101).

IEEE packages from source (`tests/corpus/ieee`, #94): std_logic_1164, numeric_std, numeric_bit,
math_real, math_complex, fixed_pkg and float_pkg bodies, 2008 and 2019, equal the reference simulator at 1, 4 and 4
shuffled threads (17 of 17, with textio of std_logic_vector, fixed and float values);
`ieee_warnings` (`ref=hand`) checks the numeric_std body's own warnings, which the reference simulator omits.
