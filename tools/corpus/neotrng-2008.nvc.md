# neotrng-2008: NVC validation

nvc 1.23-devel (1.22.0.r66.gef5084a94) (Using LLVM 21.1.8)

Every manifest entry analyzed in order into `~/.cache/rsim-corpora/nvc-neotrng-2008` with `tools/corpus/run.py neotrng-2008 --tool nvc --bless` (one file per call, `--std=2008`, each call under `timeout 300 systemd-run --user --scope -q -p MemoryMax=2G`).

- Files: 2; accepted by NVC: 2; rejected by NVC: 0. The manifest lists only files the reference tools accept (NVC and GHDL, Questa as tiebreaker); the rest are under Excluded.
- Flags needed: none.
- Licenses: neotrng: BSD-3-Clause.
